# munchfeeder
Automatic, WiFi enabled, dead simple, cat feeder. [The cat's nickname is Munch. Hence the name.]

Intentionally simply designed. Could it have a camera? Yes. Could it have used a fancy AngularJS frontend running on a pi with a 5MB homepage? Yes. Does it? No. Because I just want to feed the cat dammit.
